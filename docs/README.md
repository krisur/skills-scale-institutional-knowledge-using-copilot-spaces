# OctoAcme Project Management Processes — Overview

OctoAcme's project management framework enables teams to deliver consistent, customer-centered outcomes by combining clear roles, structured workflows, and transparent communication. Projects begin with a formal initiation process—defining business needs, measurable success, stakeholders, and risks—documented in a Project One-pager and configuration of project artifacts.

During planning, work is divided into actionable increments with detailed backlogs, testable acceptance criteria, and clear estimation of scope, dependencies, and timelines. Well-defined roles shape accountability: Product Managers steer vision and priorities; Project Managers organize schedules and risks; Developers build and test features; QA ensures release quality; Stakeholders provide ongoing alignment.

Key team ceremonies—including daily standups, weekly syncs, milestone demos, and regular retrospectives—foster rapid feedback and agile iteration. Communication is systematic: weekly status updates, monthly briefings, and incident templates guarantee that risks and decisions are visible and actionable. Risks escalate through clear paths—team triage, PM escalation, sponsor involvement—minimizing delivery interruptions.

Quality gates include robust automated and manual testing, CI/security scanning, and rigorous release checklists (validation, smoke tests, rollback plans). Metrics like velocity and burndown inform progress, while retrospectives and continuous improvement practices ensure lessons learned become process enhancements.
