# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Clarify role handoffs and collaboration touchpoints

## Role Handoffs and Collaboration Touchpoints
To ensure smooth execution, clarify these key handoffs during planning:
- **Product Manager → UX Designer**: Share user stories and acceptance criteria; UX provides design specs and prototypes
- **UX Designer → Developer**: Hand off finalized designs with interaction specs; Developer clarifies technical feasibility
- **Business Analyst → Product Manager**: Deliver validated requirements and business process documentation
- **Developer → QA/Testing**: Provide testable builds and implementation details; QA returns test results
- **Developer → Technical Writer**: Share feature specs and API changes; Technical Writer produces documentation
- **DevOps Engineer → Developer**: Provide deployment tooling and environment access; Developer provides build artifacts
- **Scrum Master → Project Manager**: Coordinate on delivery timelines and impediment escalation
- **Developer → DevOps Engineer**: Hand off deployment requirements and infrastructure needs

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
