# OctoAcme — Team Onboarding Checklist

## Purpose
Provide a standardized checklist to ensure new team members are effectively onboarded to OctoAcme projects, regardless of their role. This addresses the onboarding gap identified in process improvement initiatives.

## Overview
Effective onboarding accelerates time-to-productivity, improves role clarity, and ensures new team members understand project context, tools, and communication norms. This checklist should be completed within the first two weeks of joining a project.
