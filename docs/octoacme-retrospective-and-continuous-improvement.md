# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Facilitated by Scrum Master (if available) or Project Manager
- Include all contributing roles: Developers, QA, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Technical Writer, Business Analyst
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
