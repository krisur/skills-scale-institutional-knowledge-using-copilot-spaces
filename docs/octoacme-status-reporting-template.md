## Tips for Effective Status Reporting

1. **Be concise**: Stakeholders are busy; prioritize the most important information
2. **Use visuals**: Charts, graphs, and status indicators improve readability
3. **Be honest**: Report issues and risks transparently to enable proactive support
4. **Focus on impact**: Explain why updates matter, not just what happened
5. **Make asks clear**: Explicitly state what you need from stakeholders
6. **Maintain consistency**: Use the same format and schedule to build trust
7. **Collaborate on input**: Gather updates from all roles to ensure comprehensive reporting
8. **Archive reports**: Maintain a history for retrospectives and lessons learned

---

## Escalation Trigger
If status report shows:
- 🔴 **Red status** for 2+ consecutive weeks → Escalate to Product Lead and Sponsor
- Critical blocker with no resolution path → Immediate escalation per [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
- Milestone at risk of missing target → Escalate 2 weeks before target date

---

**Note**: This status reporting template was created to address gaps identified in [issue #5](https://github.com/krisur/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/5). For escalation paths and communication guidance, see [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md).
