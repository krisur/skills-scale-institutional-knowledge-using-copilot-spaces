# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals.

## Extended Roles
Depending on project complexity and team structure, additional specialized roles may participate:
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates sprint ceremonies, removes blockers, coaches Agile practices.
- **UX Designer**: Designs user experiences, conducts usability testing, advocates for user needs.
- **Technical Writer**: Creates and maintains technical documentation, release notes, and knowledge base.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure automation, and deployment reliability.
- **Business Analyst**: Elicits requirements, analyzes business processes, ensures stakeholder alignment.

For detailed role descriptions and interactions, see [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
